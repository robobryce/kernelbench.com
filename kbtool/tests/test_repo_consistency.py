"""Repo-wide consistency guards.

These tests exist because every failure mode they check has already happened
in this repo (see benchmarks/*/DEVLOG.md):
- forked copies of shared bench code silently diverging (mega's stale roofline
  table shipped 2.5x-wrong peaks for six weeks),
- shell entry points breaking with zero test signal (lambda_worker.sh ssh_base
  dropped its command args and every `kb lambda run` was a no-op),
- docs drifting from code (91 env vars and 15 harnesses were undocumented,
  AGENTS.md carried a flag removed from the harness).
